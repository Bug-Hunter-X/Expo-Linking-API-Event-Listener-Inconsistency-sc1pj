In this solution, we check for an initial URL on app load to catch any deep links that might have been received while the app was in the background or terminated. We also implement a more robust mechanism to ensure that the event listener is attached correctly and doesn't get detached prematurely.  We also use `Linking.getInitialURL` to handle cases where the app starts with a deep link.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUrl = (url) => {
      console.log('Deep link received:', url);
      // Handle the deep link here...
    };

    Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => setInitialUrl(url));
    const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', handleUrl);

    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialUrl) {
      console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl);
      // Handle the initial URL here...
    }
  }, [initialUrl]);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Your app content here */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
